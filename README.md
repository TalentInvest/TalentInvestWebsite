## [Demonstration](https://youtu.be/8PY6dtBlfag)

<br> 

TalentInvest is a student loan startup that uses a the Polkadot Blockchain Protocol to ledger an Income Sharing Agreement through a Smart Contract between talented students and investors willing to fund their education in an outcome reminiscent of Kickstarter and LinkedIn. TalentInvest was created by a team of 7 UC Berkeley MBA and Computer Science students from [IndEng 190E (Building with Blockchain for Web 3.0)](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2021-spring-indeng-190e-003-sem-003) to construct a blockchain backbone, develop the website, and formulate a business pitch to a panel of professors, industry leaders, and scientists. 

Our inspiration came through our common backgrounds as UC Berkeley students, many of us paying off student loans. We've seen others around us be have high potentials but be limited by finances. We look at TalentInvest as a way for students to achieve with the support of qualified and dedicated investors.

The product was grounded on and sponsored by the [Polkadot network](https://polkadot.network/), with mentorship and feedback given by engineers from IBM, Parity Technologies, and founding direction and chief scientist of the [Sutardja Center of Entreprenuership and Technoloy](https://scet.berkeley.edu/), Ikhlaq Sidhu. Our startup was highly successful, placing **2nd of 8 teams** at the prestigious class competition between UC Berkeleyâ€™s blockchain startups sponsored by the SCET.

## Engineering team TODO plans
 * Better student discovery system for investors using Aritifical Intelligence
 * Network for investors to collaborate, invest in a student as a part of a team
 * Integrate a scalable and serverless cloud database, such as on AWS or Google Cloud Firebase
 * Implement Smart Contract over multi-chain network Moonbeam and learn about the framework
